# Income-Prediction-Model

## Overview
This project involves the development of a machine learning model to predict individual incomes. Utilizing a Random Forest Classifier, the model aims to classify individuals into income categories based on various demographic and employment-related features.

## Features and Data Preprocessing
The dataset used in this project includes features such as age, education, occupation, and more. Extensive data preprocessing steps were undertaken, including:
- Encoding categorical variables
- Handling missing values
- Feature normalization and standardization

## Model Development
A Random Forest Classifier was chosen for its effectiveness in handling both categorical and continuous data. The model's hyperparameters were systematically tuned to optimize performance.

## Evaluation
The model was evaluated using accuracy as the primary metric, achieving a notable accuracy rate in predicting income levels. Further evaluation metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score were also considered to ensure a comprehensive understanding of the model's performance.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn
